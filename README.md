🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using AI/ML <br>

📌 Overview <br>
This project aims to predict Parkinson’s Disease from patient voice/audio samples using Machine Learning techniques.
The system analyzes extracted features from audio recordings and classifies whether the person is likely to have Parkinson’s Disease.
The project also includes a Streamlit-based web app where users can upload their audio sample (or input features) and instantly receive predictions.


🚀 Features <br>
🎤 Audio-based Prediction – Uses ML models to detect Parkinson’s disease.
📊 Data Processing & Feature Extraction – Includes preprocessing and feature engineering.
🤖 Machine Learning Model – Trained on medical/audio datasets.
🌐 Streamlit Frontend – Simple and interactive user interface for predictions.
📈 Performance Metrics – Model evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


🛠️ Tech Stack <br>
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend / ML: Python, Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Librosa (if audio features), Joblib/Pickle (for saving model)
Dataset: UCI Parkinson’s Dataset
